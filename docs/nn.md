- worried that DL encourages  view of black box AI which we cannot understand or control
  - that view is unacceptable, morally reprehensible
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf


- why do i look beyond DL?
  - cause there is a beyond beyond DL. what do optimization and data mining and theorem proving have in common? how can i combine them all levering advantages of each?
  - cause we have so many results where DL did not work as advertised where extras were needed, or other approaches proved better,
    - sure, DL works great for high dimensional text and visual data
      - and also for, sometimes, good for reasoning about rare data https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11410.pdf
    - but that is only a small part of the total space
      - DL is slow to tune and sometimes, older technology that runs faster (so can be tuned more effectively), does better https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01322.pdf


 - what is DL is an intermediary technology, a stepping stone to something else?

- and sometimes, you need symbols
  - human auditing
    - Figure 5 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06390.pdf
  - measuring (and repairing)discrimnationa dn farinensss
  - and working in symbolic space lets us discover massive loopholes, shortcuts, in the reasoning
    - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02922.pdf
 - 


- also, its not like when you use DL, all your remaining decisions go away
  - still a skilled task to explore alternate training methods and find a good one
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14569.pdf
  
- Now the usual reply is something about an explanation vs performance trade-off
  - "we use DLs cause they perform better" and explanation is some post-hoc process, an approximate foggy copy of the "real" model
  - we have lots of exampels were if we start with expalnation based reasoning, we cate better results (andre)


- And finally, its not just symbolic versus DL
  - there is a middle ground e.g. Symbolic-oriented optimizers tune the prams that help the DL (andre's work)
