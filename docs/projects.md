# projects

- sway vs sequential model optimize (bayes)
- try different clustering. different recursive bi-cluster
- try a project managers toolkit. 
- try and improve xiao's stuff
- anyway to map subjective opinions (from chatgpt) into search-based?
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11081.pdf
  - anyway to bias (in a good way), sway's search using LLMs?   
    - maybe not https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13298.pdf (\*)
  - hint: maybe dont use chatgpt but a local LLMso
    - see  "LLMs on the command line" at https://www.infoworld.com/article/3705035/5-easy-ways-to-run-an-llm-locally.html
    - see also https://www.infoworld.com/article/3700869/14-llms-that-arent-chatgpt.html
- testing our tools via chatgpt https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3624032.3624035
  - make sure you have a baseline (testing via some other defendable approach)

(\*) but see vivek's paper suggesting that don't matter.
