<p>
This subject will explore methods to augment standard software engineering practices with AI methods [data miners, optimizers, theorem provers] 
that that peek over over our shoulders to say try this, and don't bother that.

<p>
This is a project-based class where students will use Python to build and extend their own AI tools for software engineering. 
 500 level students will work in groups.

<p>Topics covered: theorem provers, data miners, multi-objective optimizers, semi-supervised learning, fairness/accountability/trust.

<p>Grading: 20% essay, 25% exams; 25% small homeworks, 30% for large end-of-term project.

<p>Textbook: none

Our automated tools lets us explore the world better,  so lets explore it for good.   In this class, your goal as automated software engineers
  use your automated tools to find better options

Its all about choice
- Choice and power
- and tools to better support better choices

[^picasso]: From [MFA
Masterworks](https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2018/10/31/pablo-picasso-and-cubism#:~:text=In%20collaboration%20with%20his%20friend,how%20he%20achieved%20this%20goal.):
"Pablo Picasso pioneered the Cubism movement, a revolutionary style
of modern art that Picasso formed in response to the rapidly changing
modern world.   Picasso wanted to emphasize the difference between
a painting and reality.Cubism involves different ways of seeing,
or perceiving, the world around us. He felt that we do not see an
object from one angle or perspective, but rather from many angles
selected by sight and movement. As a result of this belief, Cubism
became about _how_ to see an object or figure rather than _what_ the
artist was looking at."

Y'all yearning to be learning? Me too!

Education is the not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.   
-- W.Yeats

If the world merely lived up to our wildest dreamings, what a dull place it would be. Happily...   
-- Me

Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind
can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust,
and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a
lot of things there are to learn.  
-- T.H. White (The Once and Future King)
